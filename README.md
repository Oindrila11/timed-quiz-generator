# Timed Quiz challenge

This is a timed quiz challenge where there are 5 questions and total time is 75. The timer starts as soon as someone is attempting to take the quiz and 10 seconds is deducted every time the quiz answer is wrong.

I have tried to incorporate a section where viewers can see the highscores of people who have attempted to take the quiz. However the local storage set up was not done at this point which I intend to implement in future.

Also at the end of quiz the initial form is supposed to store the initial of the person taking the quiz and display it. unfortunately it doesn't perform that function yet. 

It was a big challenge for me to submit this assignment. i could not have done it without the help of my peers. I would like to mention @xdatalinq who was kind enough to help me out with this assignement.
